README - X-TREE-M
=================


1. What is X-Tree-M ?
---------------------

X-Tree-M ('eXtended Tree Method') is aimed to be a kind of wiki to collect all arguments, questions, facts, etc.
in a tree-like topic-structure. The goal is to prevent redundant discussions, to share knowledge and arguments
between Millions of people and to support new political activists to get substantial knowledge pretty fast and
enable them to start discussing at a higher level.
This tree structure is not intended to be an ordinary one since it is possible that two completely different 
main topics can share the same subtopic. In the future it should be possible (in case of open questions and problems) 
to provide a sophisticated workflow to solve open issues like projects. The following list provides an overview 
of other future features :


- statement extraction from fulltext sources such as chats, emails, forums, etc.
- fulltext creator -> select items from the argument / fact tree, bring them into the proper order and
  re-formulate them to make them fit in a fulltext
- merge of databases
- local copy of database for offline usage
- user login
- back / forward functionality
- comprehensive help system
- item-wise chat
- item-wise change history
...
